# Sublime-ManageLineEndings

Shows an explicit "Â¬" character to make carriage returns visible.

This is useful when word wrap is activated, which makes it hard to distinguish soft line breaks from real ones, especially when writing markdown.

# Installation

Tested under Sublime Text 3, not tested with Sublime Text 2.

Create a ShowLineEndings folder inside your Sublime Packages folder. (Go to preferences > Browse packages to get there)

Copy the files over.

# Usage

Edit settings to turn the display on/off.
